# Test
Hello and welcome to my Text Editor application! This was made in order to keep track of personal writings and to have those writings saved directly to local storage.

## How to use: 
Go to the link and go crazy. (There is no heroku link since something is wrong and nobody can figure it out)

## Link to github repos:
Repo number 1: https://github.com/AliBailoun/Text-Editor

Repo number 2: https://github.com/AliBailoun/test

There are 2 github links since I was having problems with the first repo, Text Editor, so I had to move everything to a new repo and called that one test. Initial commit messages are on the Text Editor repo, and the rest is available on the test repo. Also the test repo is my final work so that one is the one to be graded. Only refer to the Text Editor repo to look at previous commits

## Heroku link:
No link
